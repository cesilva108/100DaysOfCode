**Today's Progress**: Created a PowerShell Script to Temporarily Disable BitLocker USB Encryption. 

**Thoughts:** Instead of trying to change the registry value for Bitlocker USB Encryption everytime I had to save a file to a Non-BL enabled USB Flash Drive, I wrote a short PowerShell Script which changes the registry values. After the initial script was completed, I grappled with the issue of Unrestricting the PS ExecutionPolicy in order to run the script, which I circumvented by writing a BATCH script that Bypasses the policy and executes the PS script. 

**Points of Interest**: How can I shorten/condense the PS script? Could I write the same script as a BATCH file and just run the BATCH file by itself?
